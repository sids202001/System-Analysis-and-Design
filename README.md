# System-Analysis-and-Design for University Parking System

## Project Overview: Student Parking Permit System Documentation

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the Student Parking Permit System Documentation. This project presents a detailed conceptual framework for a system that could manage parking permits for students. Here, youâ€™ll find use cases, UML diagrams, class diagrams, sequence diagrams, and data flow diagrams that outline a proposed system to streamline parking permit management. This repository serves as a blueprint for understanding potential software solutions, focusing on design and structure rather than functional implementation.

## System Components:
- **Use Case (UC-4)**: Students interact with the system to acquire, cancel, or renew parking permits, engaging with secondary actors like the Personal Details and Vehicle Details repositories, and the Parking Authority entity.
- **Class Diagrams and Sequence Diagrams**: These diagrams illustrate the interactions between the classes (Student, Personal Details, Vehicle Details, Parking Authority) and the flow of operations during the parking permit processes.
- **Data Flow Diagram (DFD)**: Outlines the flow of data through the system, showing how information is input, stored, and managed within the system to facilitate parking permit operations.
- **UML Diagrams**: Provides a unified visual understanding of the system architecture and interactions, emphasizing how objects within the system are related and interact across various processes.

## Key Features:
- **Secure and Structured Data Entry**: The proposed system ensures that all student and vehicle details are entered through a secure and structured process, preventing data mishaps and ensuring integrity.
- **Automated Permit Management**: From acquiring to renewing or canceling parking permits, every step is automated for consistency and efficiency, reducing human error and increasing processing speed.
- **Real-Time System Feedback**: Students receive immediate updates on their permit status, enhancing user satisfaction and engagement.
- **Scalable Architecture**: The design allows for easy scaling, accommodating an increasing number of users or adapting to more complex scenarios.
